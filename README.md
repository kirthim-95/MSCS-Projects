## CS5200 - Database Management Systems

### Bitcoin Transactions Dashboard

**Overview**  
The Bitcoin Transactions Dashboard is a web application built using Streamlit that provides an interactive platform for exploring and analyzing Bitcoin transaction data. This application allows users to gain insights into transaction patterns, wallet activities, and illicit transaction behaviors through various data visualizations and analysis tools.

### Features
- **User Authentication:** Secure registration and login for users.
- **Dashboard Navigation:** Sidebar for easy navigation between different sections:
  - **Dashboard:** Key metrics and visualizations related to Bitcoin transactions.
  - **Explore Data:** EDA section to explore data tables.
  - **CSV Data Analysis:** Upload CSV files for correlation with the existing database.
  - **Transaction Analysis:** Analysis of illicit transactions, transaction IDs, and addresses.
- **Data Visualization:** Interactive charts created using Altair, Plotly, and Matplotlib.
  - Donut charts for transaction distribution.
  - Line plots for trends over time.
  - Scatter plots and heatmaps for correlation analysis.
- **Database Integration:** Connects to MySQL on GCP for real-time data analysis.
- **Interactive Graphs:** Visualizations of transaction networks and relationships.

### Technologies Used
- **Streamlit**: Web app framework.
- **MySQL**: Database for storing Bitcoin transaction data.
- **Python Libraries:**
  - pandas for data manipulation
  - numpy for numerical operations
  - matplotlib, seaborn, and altair for data visualization
  - plotly for interactive charts
  - networkx for graph analysis
  - bcrypt for password hashing
  - python-dotenv for environment variable management
